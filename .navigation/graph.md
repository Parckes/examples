## Here are structures for comfortable work with graphs

* [IGraph](.navigation/igraph.hpp) - basic interface for all implementations
### Different approaches for graph representation
* [ArcGraph](../C++/arc_graph.hpp) - graph represented by an edge list
* [MatrixGraph](../C++/matrix_graph.hpp) - graph represented by an adjacency matrix
* [ListGraph](../C++/list_graph.hpp) - graph represented by an adjacency list
* [SetGraph](../C++/set_graph.hpp) - also graph represented by an adjacency list, but for storing list we use associative container
